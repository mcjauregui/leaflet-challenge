Challenge 15
Note: Please see logicmap.js (not logic.js) for the JavaScript used to complete this project. 

The United States Geological Survey, USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The tool created in logicmap.js pulls from the USGS API the most recent 7 days worth of earthquake data from around the globe. It uses this data to visualize the realtive size (magnitude) and depth of each quake event with circular markers that are sized and colored according to event characteristics. Linked to each marker is a popup window that displays the location, date, time, magnitude, and depth of the event.
